# The ABCs of AI

A free, open-source glossary of AI terms and concepts for journalists. Built as supplementary material for the **"AI concepts you should know"** session at [NICAR 2026](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2026/) in Indianapolis (March 5-8, 2026).

### Standing on the shoulders of open source

This project is a fork of [moneyinpolitics.wtf](https://moneyinpolitics.wtf/) by [Agustin Armendariz](https://www.icij.org/journalists/agustin-armendariz/), [Anu Narayanswamy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/anu-narayanswamy/), [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) and [Derek Willis](https://thescoop.org/). Their dictionary of campaign finance jargon provided both the inspiration and the foundation for this site. We wouldn't have been able to build this without their work and the fact that they made it open source.

Ben and [Scott Klein](https://www.niemanlab.org/author/sklein/) recently wrote about the decline of open-source culture in journalism and what can be done to revive it. We couldn't agree more, and this project is our small contribution to keeping that spirit alive. Read their article: **[Journalism lost its culture of sharing. Here's how we rebuild it](https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/02/journalism-lost-its-culture-of-sharing-heres-how-we-rebuild-it/)** (Nieman Lab).

### What is this?

AI, machine learning, deep learning — what do these terms really mean, and what's the difference? Journalists are encountering an explosion of buzzwords and concepts, whether they're using AI as a tool in their reporting or covering the technology itself. This glossary aims to demystify the jargon and provide clear, practical explanations of key AI terms.

Each entry includes:

- A plain-language definition
- Real-world examples of the term in use
- Links to deeper resources for those who want to learn more

Think of it as a reference you can keep open while reading a model card, sitting in a conference session, or reporting on the latest AI developments.
